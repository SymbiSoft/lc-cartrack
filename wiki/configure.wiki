#summary Configuring GooleEarth for LCCarTrack

GoogleEarth must be properly configured to display LCCarTrack realtime data.

You must create a new "place", by adding a "Network link" (menu Add->Metwork link).
Choose your favourite name for the link, and specify this address:
http://jumpjack.altervista.org/lccartrack/lccartrack.kml

Go to "update" tabe and specify refresh time. The actual refresh time will depend on the interval specified in LCCarTrack source and on time spent by the program to send data to the server.
